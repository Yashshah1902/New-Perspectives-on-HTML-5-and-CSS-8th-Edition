<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>
     We make ourselves a place apart<br>
     Behind light words that tease and flout,<br>
     But oh, the agitated heart<br>
     Till someone find us really out.<br>
</p>

<p>
     'Tis pity if the case require <br>
     (Or so we say) that in the end <br>
We speak the literal to inspire <br>
     The understanding of a friend. <br>
</p>
 
<p>But so with all, from babes that play <br>
     At hide-and-seek to God afar, <br>
So all who hide too well away <br>
     Must speak and tell us there they are. <br>
</p>
